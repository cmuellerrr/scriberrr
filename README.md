Transcription Sucks
=========

This is a simple project where I try to make transcription slightly less shitty.

Instead of switching between applications or using special peripherals, use hotkeys on a web page to alter audio playback while keeping focus on the text you are writing.

Control audio playback with the following hotkeys:

* Toggle pause/play: `esc`
* Slow down playback: `ctrl + h`
* Jump back 2 seconds: `ctrl + j`
* Jump forward 2 seconds: `ctrl + k`
* Speed up playback: `ctrl + l`
* Add a timestamp: `enter`
